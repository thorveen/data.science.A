# ---- permutation test -----------------------------------------------------
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# We have two groups, A and B and we have data along the wavelength spectrum, 
# starting from 1 nm till 201 nm.
# We want to know if the two sets of curves are different from another.
# to do this we will use permutation test 

# --- a
# load the data file permutation.data.csv
# plot the data and give the two groups a different colour
# Do the groups look different?
p <- read.csv(paste(p.d14, " permutation.data.csv", sep = ""), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
# again the title has an odd space proceeding it.
head(p) # show the first couple of rows
str(p)  # check the structure

# make a selection for group A and B of the original data
A <- p[p$group == "A",]
B <- p[p$group == "B",]

# all the x values ( 1 to 201)
x.values <- c(1:(ncol(p)-1))
xlim.t <- c(1,(ncol(p)-1))  # the range for the x axis
ylim.t <- range(p[,-1])     # the range for the y axis

# make a vector with a different colour for each group
# this can be used to make the lines a different colour
col.t <- p$group
col.t[col.t == "A"] <- "red"
col.t[col.t == "B"] <- "green"

# make an empty plot, with ylim and xlim set as defined above
plot(NA, xlim = xlim.t, ylim = ylim.t)
# go through all the rows and plot the data using lines
# remember to exclude the first column (through the -1) as this is the group name
for(i in 1:nrow(p)) lines(x.values, p[i,-1], col = col.t[i])
# the col = col.t[i] gives the line a colour depending in its group

# --- Now to doing the pemrutation test
# rember we are free to make our own test statistic
# make loop to go through each wavelength and get 
# the difference between group A and B, square it (we are after the magnitude
# of the differences) sum it. This 'sum of squared differences' is our statistics


# ***** work with the original data *****
# make vectore to store means
mean.stor <- rep(NA, (ncol(p) - 1))
# select group A and B
A.t <- p[p$group == "A" , ]
B.t <- p[p$group == "B" , ]
# go through each wavelength (column), starting at column 2
for(i in 2:ncol(p)){
  print(i)  # print iteration number to console
  # not neded if everything goes well, but you can track progress this way
  # i <- 1    # little 'hack' so you can test if all goes well for a specific
  # value of i. not neded if all goes well
  A.tm <- mean(A.t[,i]) # get mean of A
  B.tm <- mean(B.t[,i]) # get mean of B
  # take the differnce between A and B and square it. Store in vector
  mean.stor[i - 1] <- (A.tm - B.tm)^2
}
# our final statistic of the original data is the sum of all the squared differences
real.test.statistic <- sum(mean.stor) 


# ==== let's up a permutation to get null distribution ====
iter <- 1000  # number of iterations for the null distribution
storage.perm <- rep(NA, iter) # storage for your final test statistic

# the main loop, to through all iterations
for(k in 1:iter){
  #k <- 1
  perm.data <- p    # make copy of original data set (not necesarily needed)
  # ramdomly reshuffle the group column
  # this is the crux of the permutation test as this breaks down
  # any relationship within groups
  perm.data$group <- sample(p$group, length(p$group), replace = FALSE )

  # same as abov, split the data frame in group A and B
  A.t <- perm.data[perm.data$group == "A" , ]
  B.t <- perm.data[perm.data$group == "B" , ]
  # loop to go through all wavelength (1 to 201)
  for(i in 2:ncol(perm.data)){
    print(i)
    #i <- 2
    A.tm <- mean(A.t[,i])
    B.tm <- mean(B.t[,i])
    mean.stor[i - 1] <- (A.tm - B.tm)^2
    # end of the loop for one wavelenght
  }
  # one iteration for the permutation test done.
  # store the squared differences between the means
  storage.perm[k] <- sum(mean.stor)
}

# we now have the null distribution, plot it
hist(storage.perm)
# we also have our original test statistic value.
# check how many values or more extrme under the null distribution
# divide this number by number of iterations to get the p value
# multiply by 2 as the test is two-tailed

2 * (length(storage.perm[storage.perm > real.test.statistic]) + 1)/iter
